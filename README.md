Description
----

The notebook reads a pair of left and right images, and the ground-truth disparity map.
It then minimizes a functional using a primal-dual proximal point method to infer the disparity map.
The cost to minimize is plotted as well as the distance to the ground-truth and various statistics to monitor convergence.
